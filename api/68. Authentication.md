### Types of authentication

- Basic
	- Send username and passoword with each request
	- > One of them is basic authentication and this is basic Hastie type authentication, where you simply send the username and password along with each request for every request that you make. So any request that's made to the API will include the user's username and password with that request. And this is quite a bad way of authenticating in my opinion, because it means that the client needs to store the user's username and password. So it's not just used to authenticate with, it's used to store in the client system and then make requests. Every single time you make the request, you need to send a clear text, username and password.
- Token
	- Use a token in the HTTP header
- JSON Web Token (JWT)
	- Use an access and refresh token
	- > You also have JSON web tokens, which is a type of authentication that's similar to the token authentication. However, it works by using a refresh and access token.
	- And the refresh token is the only token that requires verification of the user's credentials.So basically, people use this type of authentication when you need something that is super scalable. And maybe you have an app that has millions and millions and millions of users and you want to reduce the number of requests made to a relational database. And this is quite an advanced type of authentication, requires some external libraries and packages to get up and running.
- Session
	- Use cookies
	- We also have session authentication and this is when you store the authentication details using cookies and it's the common type of authentication is used for authenticating websites. So for example, when you log in with the Django, I mean, it's using session authentication behind the scenes in order to keep and store your user information so that you can be authenticated.

### Token authentication
- Balance of simplicity and security
- Supported out of the box by DRF
- Well support ny most clients
- We're going to be using token authentication in this course. And the reason we're going to be using it is because I find it has the right balance of simplicity and security. So it's not the most secure option, but it is a pretty secure option as long as you implement it in the front end properly. And it is very simple, it's included with Django rest framework out the box. We don't need to install and configure any other external packages or dependencies in order to get it working. And it's also supported by most clients. So any client that can store data on the client side, either in the session memory or actually on the disk, can use this type of authentication because all you need to do is store the token and include it with every request that you need to make to the API that has to be authenticated.

### Pros and cons
- Pros
	- Supported out of the box
	- Simple to use
	- Supported by all clients
	- Avoid sening username/password each time
- Cons
	- Token needs to be secure
	- Requires database requests
### Logging out
- Happens on the client side
- Delete token

### Why no logout API?
- Unreliable
	- No guarantee it will be called
- Not useful on API
So people ask all the time in the Q&A of the course, why do we not have a log out API?
So why don't we actually if we have a log in API to create a token, then why don't we also have a logout API to log the user out? Well, the answer to this is that a log API is very unreliable.
There's no point creating this type of API because there's no guarantee that the user is actually going to use it to log out. And what I mean by that is that there are many different situations where it may not be possible for the client application to cool the log API in order to log the user out. So it wouldn't really be creating reliable data in the system. If your goal is to know when users actually logged out via an API, then you wouldn't really know that by this API because for example, if you're creating a front end app, which is a mobile app, so let's say you have an Android or iOS app and then the user just deletes the app entirely while they're logged in, then the app isn't going to able to cool the log out API. Another example could be if they totally disconnect off the internet or if they are using a web browser and they just clear the session entirely, then the web browser application isn't going to have the Information it needs to cool the log API.
So there's just is really no point creating a log out API because the data you get from it is not going to be reliable anyway.
It's also not really useful to have this type of API because as I mentioned, it's unreliable and unless
you have a specific use case for your project, then I wouldn't recommend trying to implement a log
out API.
Of course, if there is a specific reason, maybe some niche case where you do want to have a log out API, then you could always create one pretty easily.
It wouldn't take much code to create that.
You just need something that deletes the token from the database and accepts delete request, then something like that.

### Quiz
> What is a drawback of using Basic authentication?

This is not ideal because it means an attacker could retrieve the user's credentials in clear text.
