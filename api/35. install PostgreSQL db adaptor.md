```yml
#line 15
# Psycopg2 vozlwldhk Postgres를 연결하기 위한 패키지
# 1
apk add --update --no-cache postgresql-client && \
#line 16-17
# 가상환경 의존성 패키지
# 2
apk add --update --no-cache --virtual .tmp-build-dev \
    builde-base postgresql-dev musl-dev && \

#lin 23
  apk del .tmp-build-deps && \
```

2. So below this line, we listed the packages that we needed in order to install our Postgres adapter.

3. is it removes these packages that we installed up here on line 17.
   
   So because they were installed under the name temp build deps, we can install them easily without having
   
   to name them individually later on.
   
   And this just keeps outlook of file as lightweight as possible, so it keeps it lightweight and clean.
