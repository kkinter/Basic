### Problem with Docker compose
- Using `depends_on`  ensures service starts
	- Doesn't ensure application is running
### Docker services timeline
And the further we get down this diagram here, the longer it's been.
So when we first start, we're at the top and then we work our way down because we've configured our
depends on on our Django app.
We've said that the app depends on the database.
So Docker Compose makes sure that the database starts first.
So the database is starting.
And then as soon as the database finishes starting, the Django app will then stop.
However, just because the database has started, it doesn't mean that it's finished setting up and
ready to accept connections.
In fact, when you first run your database, it can take quite a long time for it to do the initial
setup of Postgres in order for it to be ready to accept connections.
And this can actually take longer than it takes Django to start after both the database and the Django
App Service has started.
So as soon as the Django app finishes starting, it will then try and connect to the database.
But Postgres is still in the process of starting, so it's not ready to accept connections yet.
So the Django app will crash, it will get an exception and it will crash and it will say something
like unable to find the database and then the Postgres database will be ready.
But the Django app has already crashed and we would need to restart the service again from the beginning

### Solution
- Make Django "wait for db"
	- Check for DB availability
	- Continue when DB ready
- Create custom Django management command

### When is this an issue?
- Running `docker-compose` locally
- Running on deployed environment
